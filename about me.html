    <div class="container">
        <div class="page-header" style="background-color: #3282b8;">
            <p class="welcome">Welcome to my page!<br></p>
            <p class="about">I am Clara, a Full Stack Developer wannabe from Porto who is passionate for coding & fashion.</p>
            <p class="about">In 2019, I specialized in web & mobile development and I worked in the IT sector at companies like
                <a href="https://www.weblevel.pt/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Weblevel</a> and <a href="https://iconsulting-group.com/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Iconsulting
                 Group</a>.
                <br> My role was as a Front-End Developer and when I started, I was scared to death of not being able to carry out the tasks assigned to me. First things first, JavaScript was like a real monster to me, what for a Front-End Developer is
                not very helpful! Then, I had an Internship where they used nopCommerce to do E-Commerce Platforms... That thing isn't pretty!! At all!!
                <br> But I am proud to have overcome all these fears with investment in more knowledge - online courses - with a lot of practice and also the teamwork effort helped me a lot!</p>
            <p class="about">Personally, I love fashion. I appreciate going to the cinema and also relaxing at home watching TV series. On the other hand, I also enjoy hiking by the riverside - especially in Autumn, my favourite season. Love the leaves falling, the changing
                colours, the sound of the footsteps on dry leaves.
                <br>Make-up addicted, recently discovered a love for home decoration & the butterflies are something that is always on my personal things. I really appreciate the perspective of evolution that they demonstrate.</p>

            <p class="welcome">"You don't grow when you're comfortable"</p>
            <p class="about">What motivates me most is looking for new challenges, because I enjoy new opportunities to learn, to grow and to help others. Every day I try to challenge myself in some way.
                <br> My planning and organizational ability, problem-solving skills, responsive design principles, website optimization and quickly learning new skills & program languages are my main professional characteristics to help me achieve my
                major goal: to be a Full Stack Developer.</p>
            <p class="about">I would love to join a team where we can make things happen, with enthusiasm, creativity, agility & flexibility, whereby the combination of different talents & skills we could achieve limitless perspectives to evolve, grow & serve your company's
                goals.
                <br>Because it is much more than a job, it is a passion that you grow with every day, it is a way of life.</p>
            <p class="about">I see myself in the future trying different areas across this IT business. It is a very interesting idea. One more time, learn, grow and climb steps in my career to the ideal point that guarantees me personal and professional fulfilment and
                reach my full potential.</p>
